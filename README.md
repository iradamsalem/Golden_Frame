## üß† Label Inference System

The analyzer uses a smart `inferLabels()` method to add missing labels when the system detects partial information (e.g., `beard`, `smile`, `eyebrow`) but doesn't explicitly tag the image with `person`.

This helps maintain accurate, fair scoring across all categories ‚Äî even when Google Vision misses key context.

---

## üß™ How It Works

- Each photo is passed through Google Vision and other processors.
- Data is enriched with resolution, brightness, sharpness, and label inference.
- A weighted scoring algorithm per category evaluates and ranks the photos.
- Output: Ranked photo list per target category.
